## To Do
- [x] Get link to level
- [ ] Get level name/description
- [ ] Get server leaderboard (via AoC API)
- [ ] Get user's scores
- [ ] Limit commands (like `code` or `join`) to specific roles
- [ ] Connect GitHub
- [ ] Get user's solutions for level (if they have a GitHub connection)
- [ ] Find a way to cache leaderboard (AoC limits API requests)
- [ ] Figure out a better way to save and access data in general lol
- [ ] Hosting? Deployment? What's that?
